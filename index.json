We both analyse how well PLMs generalize when the test data is in the same distribution as the train data and when it is different, for the latter analysis, we have also designed a cross-distribution test set other than the in-distribution test set. We conduct experiments on one of the most advanced and publicly released generative PLM - BART. Our research finds that the PLMs can easily generalize when the distribution is the same, however, it is still difficult for them to generalize out of the distribution.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Generalization Ability of Pretrained Language Models on Arithmetic and Logical Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuchen Niu"],"categories":null,"content":"Serverless computing is a growing cloud framework that removes the barriers of resource provision and scaling from the cloud users. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a way to deploy an application, as a set of functions, to serverless backends in the cloud. The functions are usually short-lived and have unpredictable invocation patterns. A typical cloud environment has multiple tenants coreside on a server. The combination of the multitenancy and functions’ characterization leads to that a serverless platform has to address the potential overheads of burstable invocations. This project studies the architectural implications of serverless computing under a high multitenancy. We explicitly measure the throughput and hardware performance counters of a server while the number of tenants varies. We find that the server suffers an approximately 40% of throughput loss when the number of tenants exceeds the number of physical cores. The characteristics of hardware performance counters show that the contention of data demands on the memory subsystem is rapidly aggravated as the number of tenants increases. When two tenants coreside on the same physical core, the contention on the instruction fetch may overtake the stalls in the memory subsystem. We also conform that the interleaves short functions from multiple tenants are harmful to the localitypreserving microarchitectural structures. We open-source an automated profiling tool in the vHive, which we developed for this project.\n","date":1618185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618185600,"objectID":"a203daa28124b31323ea595b41a2c343","permalink":"https://example.com/project/ug_thesis/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ug_thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Serverless computing is a growing cloud framework that removes the barriers of resource provision and scaling from the cloud users.
